## General Questions

### What is QuorumCredit?

QuorumCredit is a decentralized microlending platform on Stellar Soroban that replaces traditional asset collateral with **social collateral**. Instead of locking up $100 to borrow $50, borrowers get vouched for by their trust network. Vouchers stake XLM to back borrowers they trust, earning 2% yield on successful repayment.

### How is QuorumCredit different from traditional lending?

| Aspect | Traditional | QuorumCredit |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Collateral | Asset-based (over-collateralized) | Social (trust-based) |
| Access | Credit score required | Trust network required |
| Fees | High (1-5% origination) | Low (protocol fees only) |
| Speed | Days to weeks | Minutes |
| Transparency | Opaque | On-chain, auditable |

### Is QuorumCredit safe?

QuorumCredit has undergone security audits and implements multiple safeguards:
- Multi-sig admin controls
- Pause mechanism for emergencies
- Slash mechanism to penalize defaults
- Yield reserve pre-funding to ensure solvency
- Comprehensive error handling

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for details.

### What blockchain does QuorumCredit use?

QuorumCredit is built on **Stellar Soroban**, a smart contract platform on the Stellar blockchain. Stellar offers:
- Near-zero transaction fees
- Fast finality (~5 seconds)
- Native XLM token
- Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus

### What tokens does QuorumCredit support?

- **Primary token**: XLM (Stellar's native asset)
- **Additional tokens**: Any SEP-41-compliant token approved by admins

## For Borrowers

### How do I get a loan?

1. **Build your trust network**: Ask friends, family, or community members to vouch for you
2. **Recruit vouchers**: Each voucher stakes XLM to back your loan
3. **Meet the threshold**: Once total vouched stake meets your requested threshold, you're eligible
4. **Request the loan**: Call `request_loan()` with your desired amount
5. **Receive funds**: Loan is disbursed to your wallet immediately

### What's the minimum loan amount?

The default minimum is **100,000 stroops (0.01 XLM)**. Admins can adjust this via `set_min_loan_amount()`.

### What's the maximum loan amount?

The default maximum is **10,000,000,000 stroops (1,000 XLM)**. Admins can adjust this via `set_max_loan_amount()`.

### How long do I have to repay?

The default loan duration is **30 days**. After the deadline, the loan is considered in default and vouchers can vote to slash your collateral.

### What happens if I don't repay?

1. **After deadline**: Loan enters default status
2. **Vouchers vote**: Vouchers can vote to slash your collateral
3. **Slash executed**: 50% of each voucher's stake is burned
4. **Blacklist**: You may be blacklisted from future borrowing
5. **Credit impact**: Your default count increases, affecting future eligibility

### Can I repay early?

Yes! You can repay at any time before the deadline. Early repayment is encouraged and doesn't incur penalties.

### Can I repay partially?

Yes, you can make partial repayments. The loan remains active until fully repaid.

### What if I need more time?

Contact your vouchers to discuss options:
- **Refinance**: Request a new loan to pay off the old one
- **Extend deadline**: Vouchers may agree to extend (requires admin support)
- **Negotiate**: Work with vouchers on alternative arrangements

### How is my credit score calculated?

Your credit score is based on:
- **Repayment history**: On-time repayments increase score
- **Default count**: Defaults decrease score
- **Loan amount**: Larger loans increase score if repaid
- **Voucher count**: More vouchers increase score

See [Reputation System](../docs/reputation-system.md) for details.

## For Vouchers

### Why should I vouch for someone?

**Benefits**:
- **Earn yield**: 2% annual yield on staked XLM
- **Help your community**: Enable access to credit for underserved populations
- **Low risk**: Diversify across multiple borrowers
- **Transparent**: On-chain, auditable transactions

### How much should I stake?

This depends on:
- **Your risk tolerance**: Higher stake = higher potential loss if default
- **Borrower trustworthiness**: More trusted borrowers warrant higher stakes
- **Diversification**: Spread stakes across multiple borrowers
- **Minimum requirement**: At least 50 stroops to earn non-zero yield

**Example**: Stake 1 XLM (10,000,000 stroops) across 5 borrowers = 200,000 stroops each.

### What's the minimum stake?

**50 stroops (0.000005 XLM)** is the minimum to earn non-zero yield. Smaller stakes will not generate yield due to rounding.

### Can I increase my stake?

Yes! Use `increase_stake()` to add more XLM to an existing vouch. This increases the borrower's eligibility and your potential yield.

### Can I decrease my stake?

Yes! Use `decrease_stake()` to reduce your stake, but it must remain above the minimum (50 stroops). You cannot decrease below the minimum.

### Can I withdraw my vouch?

Yes! Use `withdraw_vouch()` to completely remove your vouch and get your stake back. However:
- **Cannot withdraw during active loan**: Your stake is locked while the borrower has an active loan
- **Can withdraw after repayment**: Once the loan is repaid, you can withdraw

### What happens if the borrower defaults?

1. **Loan enters default**: After deadline without repayment
2. **Vouchers vote**: You can vote to slash the borrower's collateral
3. **Slash executed**: If quorum is met, 50% of your stake is burned
4. **Remaining stake**: You keep 50% of your original stake

**Example**: You stake 1 XLM, borrower defaults, you lose 0.5 XLM.

### How do I vote on a slash?

1. **Initiate slash vote**: Admin or any voucher calls `initiate_slash_vote(borrower)`
2. **Cast your vote**: Call `vote_slash(voucher, borrower, approve)` with `approve=true` or `false`
3. **Quorum check**: Once 50% of total stake votes to approve, slash executes automatically

### When do I receive my yield?

Yield is distributed when the borrower repays the loan:
- **Timing**: Immediately upon successful repayment
- **Amount**: `stake * 2% = stake * 200 / 10_000`
- **Minimum**: Stake must be ≥ 50 stroops to receive non-zero yield

**Example**: You stake 1 XLM (10,000,000 stroops), borrower repays, you receive 10,000,000 + 200,000 = 10,200,000 stroops.

### Can I vouch for multiple borrowers?

Yes! You can vouch for as many borrowers as you want. Each vouch is independent.

### Can I vouch for the same borrower multiple times?

No. You can only have one active vouch per borrower per token. Use `increase_stake()` to add more to an existing vouch.

### Is there a cooldown between vouches?

Yes. By default, there's a **24-hour cooldown** between vouch calls for the same voucher. This prevents rapid stake changes.

## For Operators

### How do I deploy the contract?

See [Deployment Guide](../docs/deployment-guide.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### How do I set up multisig admin?

1. **Create admin addresses**: Generate or import multiple admin keypairs
2. **Initialize with admins**: Pass admin addresses and threshold during initialization
3. **Require signatures**: All admin functions require `admin_threshold` signatures

**Example**: 3-of-5 multisig requires 3 out of 5 admins to sign.

### How do I pause the contract?

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID --fn pause --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_SECRET_KEY -- --admin_signers '["'$ADMIN_ADDRESS'"]'
```

### How do I unpause the contract?

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID --fn unpause --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_SECRET_KEY -- --admin_signers '["'$ADMIN_ADDRESS'"]'
```

### How do I update configuration?

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID --fn update_config --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_SECRET_KEY -- \
  --admin_signers '["'$ADMIN_ADDRESS'"]' \
  --yield_bps 300 \
  --slash_bps 5000
```

### How do I upgrade the contract?

See [Deployment Guide - Upgrading](../docs/deployment-guide.md#upgrading-the-contract).

### How do I monitor contract health?

Use the monitoring commands in [Troubleshooting Guide - Monitoring](../docs/troubleshooting-guide.md#monitoring-contract-health).

### How do I handle a security incident?

1. **Pause the contract**: Immediately pause to halt user activity
2. **Investigate**: Determine the scope and impact
3. **Fix**: Deploy patched WASM via `upgrade()`
4. **Communicate**: Notify users and stakeholders
5. **Unpause**: Resume operations once fixed

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for incident response procedures.

### How do I manage the yield reserve?

1. **Pre-fund**: Transfer XLM to contract before loans are disbursed
2. **Monitor**: Check `get_fee_treasury()` regularly
3. **Replenish**: Add more XLM if reserve is depleted
4. **Withdraw**: Use `withdraw_slash_treasury()` to collect slashed funds

## Technical Questions

### What's a stroop?

A **stroop** is Stellar's smallest indivisible unit:
- 1 XLM = 10,000,000 stroops
- 1 stroop = 0.0000001 XLM (10⁻⁷ XLM)

All contract amounts are in stroops.

### How is yield calculated?

Yield is calculated as:
```
yield = stake * yield_bps / 10_000
```

Where `yield_bps` is basis points (default: 200 = 2%).

**Example**: 1 XLM (10,000,000 stroops) at 2% = 10,000,000 * 200 / 10_000 = 200,000 stroops.

### How is slash calculated?

Slash is calculated as:
```
slashed = stake * slash_bps / 10_000
```

Where `slash_bps` is basis points (default: 5000 = 50%).

**Example**: 1 XLM (10,000,000 stroops) at 50% = 10,000,000 * 5000 / 10_000 = 5,000,000 stroops lost.

### What's the max loan-to-stake ratio?

The default ratio is **2:1** (borrow up to 2x your total vouched stake). Admins can adjust via `set_max_loan_to_stake_ratio()`.

### Can I use multiple tokens?

Yes! Admins can approve additional SEP-41 tokens via `add_allowed_token()`. Each vouch and loan specifies its token.

### How does the contract handle overflow?

The contract uses `i128` for all amounts and checks for overflow:
- `StakeOverflow` error if summing vouches would overflow
- Safe arithmetic with explicit checks

### Is the contract upgradeable?

Yes! Admins can upgrade the contract WASM via `upgrade()`. This requires `admin_threshold` signatures.

### How do I verify contract integrity?

1. **Check source**: Verify contract source on GitHub
2. **Audit WASM**: Compare deployed WASM hash with built WASM
3. **Monitor events**: Subscribe to contract events for anomalies
4. **Verify state**: Periodically check contract storage for consistency

### What's the contract's audit status?

QuorumCredit has undergone security audits. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for audit reports and findings.
